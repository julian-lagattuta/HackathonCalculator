# Hackathon Calculator
Written in Unity + C#.

This is the code for a calculator which will convert a dollar amount into a visual representation of coins and dollar bills. 

For example: If I were to type $3.50 into the calculator, it would display three US $1 dollar bills and two quarters.

This helps disabled workers who struggle to convert the change calculated by a machine into real money.
