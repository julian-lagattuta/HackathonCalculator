# Hackathon Calculator
Written in Unity + C#.


# Overview

This is the code for a calculator which will convert a dollar amount into a visual representation of coins and dollar bills. 

For example: If I were to type $3.50 into the calculator, it would display three US $1 dollar bills and two quarters.

This helps disabled workers who struggle to convert the change calculated by a machine into real money.



# About the Hackathon Prospector Challenge
The 36-hour challenge task was to develop something to help the Prospector Theater, a non-profit that employs people with learning disabilities. I was in 8th grade, but the challenge was for all age groups. I brought a friend who was good at 3D modeling. Talking with the manager from the Prospector Theater, we learned that staff had difficulty sorting money into the cash registers and converting dollars in numbers to real dollar bills. For our first project, we created a change visualizer tool in Unity. The user enters a number in dollars and cents (as it might appear on the register, i.e. the change an employee needs to give a customer), and an image is generated of the bills and coins necessary to total that amount. Our second project was a 3D cash register simulator game, that teaches money-sorting into a cash register. In the game, the user receives money in payment, and has to sort it correctly into the register, then give correct change. The Prospector judge announcing our win said that our project “stood out far above all others” and was the most “well thought-out, polished, and impressive” project there
 (Note: Oddly, news reports don’t name me as “winner,”  only as a “participant.” It’s possible St. Luke’s didn’t mention my win in its press release; I was not a student there. My win isn’t on their web page).
